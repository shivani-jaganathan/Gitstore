Neural Style Transfer focuses on PyTorch implementation of neural style transfer. An application of deep learning called neural style transfer enables us to blend the style of one image with the content of another image. Understanding the neural style transfer process and how it might be applied to produce beautiful images is the aim of this. 
The pre-trained VGG-19 network, a convolutional neural network that has been trained on millions of photos for object detection, is loaded first in this process. A pre-trained convolutional neural network is utilised in this method, which is based on the neural style transfer algorithm, to extract features from both the content image and the style image. The algorithm operates by minimising a total loss function, which is composed of the sum of two individual loss functions, namely, content loss and style loss. In order to achieve the required style transfer, the total loss is then minimised using an optimizer to update the target image. The Python programming language and PyTorch deep learning framework are used to carry out the project. To achieve neural style transfer, we make use of a number of PyTorch modules, including torch.nn, torch.optim, and torchvision.transforms. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the neural style transfer technique, a visualisation of the project's intermediate and final results is also provided.
